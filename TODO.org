#+TITLE: MTA Bus Codes TODO

** prioritize getting this neat and out
** figure out how to group the bus routes:
*** math constraints:
**** 14954 unique stops
**** need to have no more than 10 layers
**** each layer can't have more than 2000
*** user-interface:
**** it'd be easiest to simply have one color per-layer
**** -> shouldn't have all bus in the same neighborhood in the same color
**** could be good to distinguish by direction & neighborhood (we can get the neighborhood from the longname)
***** keep in mind you can actually set the color by direction in the UI itself
***** can't figure out if it's bad or good that the direction-color mapping isn't consistent across layers
***** I think opposite directions should definitely be heavily differentiated
**** unfortunately cannot really rely on the grouping coming from the API
**** ideally 'duplicate' stops should have all of their routes within the same layer:
eg bus has routes B36 and B45, if I put B36 in a separate layer, the stop won't show for B45
**** (for later consideration) it is however nice to have express bus stops with a different color. Could maybe achieve this by having express be its own specific layer
